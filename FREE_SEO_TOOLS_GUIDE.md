## PART 1: FREE KEYWORD RESEARCH TOOLS

**How to use:**

```
1. Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console
2. Add your website (verify ownership)
3. Navigate to: Performance > Search results
4. See:
   - Keywords you rank for
   - Average position
   - Impressions (how many times you appeared)
   - Clicks (how many clicked through)
   - CTR (click-through rate)
```

**Key insights:**

a) **Low-hanging fruit:** Keywords where you rank #11-20 (page 2)
   - These are easiest to move to page 1
   - Filter by: Position 11-20
   - Focus on improving these pages first

b) **High impression, low clicks:** Good position but bad CTR
   - Position 1-10 but CTR < 5%
   - Fix: Improve meta title/description
   - Make them more compelling

   - Already getting some traction
