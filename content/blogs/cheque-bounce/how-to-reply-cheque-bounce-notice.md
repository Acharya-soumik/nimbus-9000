# Received Cheque Bounce Notice? How to Reply & Defend

Receiving a legal notice usually triggers panic. But Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act has specific loopholes and defenses. If you have been wrongly accused, or if the notice is defective, you can win this battle before it even reaches the courtroom.

Here is a strategic guide for the **accused (drawer)**.

## 🛑 Immediate Steps (Do NOT Ignore)

### 1. The Clock is Ticking
You have **15 days** from the receipt of the notice to pay. If you don't pay, the sender can file a case.
*   **Do NOT throw it away.** The envelope with the date stamp is a crucial piece of evidence.
*   **Read it:** Check if the cheque number matches your records.

### 2. Silence is Not Gold
In civil/criminal law, silence can sometimes be interpreted as an admission. You **MUST** send a reply to the legal notice, denying the liability (if you have grounds).

## 🛡️ Top 4 Valid Legal Defenses

Not every bounced cheque leads to conviction. Here are the strongest defenses used in courts:

### 1. "Security Cheque" Defense
*   **Argument:** "This cheque was given blank as a SECURITY for a loan, not for repayment. The loan amount is disputed or already paid in cash."
*   **Legal Standing:** The Supreme Court has ruled that if a cheque is for security, and the debt amount wasn't "crystallized" (finalized) on the date of the cheque, Section 138 may not apply.
*   **Proof Needed:** Loan agreement mentioning security cheque numbers, WhatsApp chats, witnesses.

### 2. "Time-Barred Debt" Defense
*   **Argument:** "The debt is from 5 years ago. It is time-barred."
*   **Legal Standing:** Under the limitation act, a debt expires after 3 years. A cheque cannot be used to revive a dead debt. Such a complaint is liable to be quashed.

### 3. "Lost/Stolen Cheque" Defense
*   **Argument:** "I lost my signed chequebook. I filed an FIR or 'Stop Payment' request BEFORE this date."
*   **Legal Standing:** If you can prove you reported the loss to the bank/police *before* the cheque was presented, it proves no intent to pay/defraud.

### 4. "Material Alteration" Defense
*   **Argument:** "I signed a cheque for ₹10,000, but they added a zero to make it ₹1,00,000."
*   **Legal Standing:** Any visible alteration or ink difference without your countersign makes the instrument void. Forensic analysis can prove this.

## ✍️ How to Draft a Strong Reply

Your reply sets the tone for your defense.

### Essential Elements of a Reply:
1.  **Denial:** Categorically deny that you owe the claimed amount.
2.  **The True Story:** Briefly state your version (e.g., "The goods supplied were defective and returned").
3.  **Warning:** Warn them that filing a false case will lead to counter-prosecution for defamation or cheating.

> [!CAUTION]
> **Don't Admit Too Much:**
> Avoid phrases like "I will pay next month" in your reply/chats. This is an admission of debt and will be used against you.

### Template Phrase for Reply
*"That my client denies legally owing the said sum of Rs. X towards you. The subject cheque was issued merely as a security which you have misused despite the fact that the underlying transaction was cancelled..."*

## 🤝 Settlement: The Smart Exit

If you genuinely owe the money (or part of it), fighting a Section 138 case is often a losing battle due to the presumption of guilt.

### Why Settle?
*   **Avoid Criminal Record:** A conviction stays on record.
*   **Save Costs:** Lawyer fees for 2-3 years will exceed the interest.
*   **Reduce Amount:** Lenders often agree to waive interest if you offer a lump sum immediate payment.

### How to Settle Safe?
1.  **Written Agreement:** Draft a Compromise Deed / Settlement Memo.
2.  **Return of Cheque:** Ensure they return the ORIGINAL cheque.
3.  **Court Seal:** If the case is already filed, submit the settlement in Lok Adalat to get a formal "Compounded and Acquitted" order.
