# Cheque Bounce Legal Notice Format & Rules (2026)

The **Legal Notice** is the foundation of your entire Section 138 case. It is not just a letter; it is a **statutory requirement**. 

If your notice is defective, your complaint will be dismissed by the court, often after 2-3 years of fighting, forcing you to start from scratch. This guide ensures you get it right the first time.

## 📝 The "Golden 5" Ingredients of a Valid Notice

According to the Negotiable Instruments Act and landmark Supreme Court judgments (like *Central Bank of India vs Saxons Farms*), a notice must strictly contain these five elements:

1.  **Fact of Presentation:** You must state that you presented the cheque to the bank.
2.  **Fact of Dishonour:** You must state that the cheque was returned unpaid, citing the exact memo date and reason.
3.  **Clear Demand:** You must explicitly demand the payment of the **"amount of the cheque"**.
4.  **15-Day Timeline:** You must explicitly give the defaulter **15 days** from the receipt of notice to pay.
5.  **Assertive Language:** It must communicate that you intend to take legal action if unpaid.

> [!WARNING]
> **The "Interest" Trap**
> Do NOT add interest or legal charges to the *principal demand sum*.
> *   **Wrong:** "Pay me Rs. 1,00,000 (Cheque) + Rs. 5,000 (Notice Cost) = Rs. 1,05,000"
> *   **Right:** "Pay me Rs. 1,00,000 (Cheque Amount). Separately, you are also liable for Rs. 5,000 costs."
> *   *Why?* The Supreme Court ruled that demand must be for the "cheque amount". Adding other sums to the main demand can invalidate the notice (case: *Suman Sethi vs Ajay K. Churiwal*).

Dear Sir/Madam,

Under the instructions and authority of my client, **[Your Name/Company Name]**, resident/office at **[Your Address]**, I serve you with the following legal notice:

1.  That you are well acquainted with my client and had approached my client for [Brief Reason: e.g., a friendly loan of Rs. 5 Lakhs / purchase of goods vide Invoice No. 123].

    *   **Amount:** Rs. [Amount in Figures] (Rupees [Amount in Words])
    *   **Bank:** [Bank Name & Branch]

## ❌ Common Drafting Mistakes to Avoid

1.  **Wrong Cheque Number:** A typo in the cheque number (e.g., 123456 vs 123465) is fatal. Double-check.
2.  **Vague Demand:** Saying "Pay the loan amount" instead of "Pay the cheque amount".
3.  **Missing "15 Days":** If you demand payment "immediately" or "within 7 days", the notice is invalid. New Section 138(b) strictly requires 15 days.
4.  **Sending via WhatsApp Only:** While newer judgments allow WhatsApp service (see *In Re Cognizance for Extension of Limitation*), it is secondary proof. Always prioritize **RPAD (Registered Post)**.

## 📬 How to Send It Correctly

*   **Mode:** Speed Post or Registered Post with Acknowledgment Due (RPAD).
*   **Address:** Send it to the last known correct address. If the defaulter is a company, send it to the Company AND its Directors.
*   **Proof:** Keep the postal receipt and print the online tracking report showing "Item Delivered" or "Item Returned".
*   **Unclaimed:** If the notice returns with "Unclaimed" or "Refused", keep the sealed envelope AS IS. **Do not open it.** Hand it over to the court during trial.
