Consumer rights in India are protected under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019, which provides a comprehensive framework for addressing consumer grievances and ensuring fair trade practices.

## Your Rights as a Consumer
Every consumer in India has the following fundamental rights:
- **Right to Safety:** Protection against hazardous goods and services
- **Right to Information:** Access to complete product information
- **Right to Choose:** Access to a variety of products at competitive prices
- **Right to be Heard:** Your grievances must be addressed
- **Right to Seek Redressal:** Fair settlement of disputes
- **Right to Consumer Education:** Awareness about rights and responsibilities

## How to File a Consumer Complaint
If you face issues with a product or service, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Document Everything
Keep all receipts, bills, warranty cards, and communication with the seller. Take photos or videos if the product is defective.

### Step 2: Contact the Seller/Service Provider
Before taking legal action, try to resolve the issue directly. Send a written complaint and keep a copy.

### Step 3: Send a Legal Notice
If the issue remains unresolved, send a formal legal notice demanding resolution within 15 days.

### Step 4: File a Complaint with Consumer Forum
Based on the value of goods/services, file your complaint with:
- **District Forum:** Claims up to ₹1 crore
- **State Commission:** Claims ₹1 crore to ₹10 crore
- **National Commission:** Claims above ₹10 crore

> "Consumer protection is not just about getting compensation—it's about creating accountability and improving business practices."

## Time Limits for Filing Complaints
Consumer complaints must be filed within **2 years** from the date of cause of action. However, this period can be extended if there's sufficient cause for delay.

## Online Consumer Complaint Portal
The government has launched the **e-Daakhil portal** for filing consumer complaints online. This makes the process faster and more accessible.
