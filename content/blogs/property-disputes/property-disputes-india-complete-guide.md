Property disputes are among the most common legal issues faced by Indians. Whether it's a boundary dispute with a neighbor, issues with property documentation, or inheritance conflicts, understanding your rights is crucial.

## Common Types of Property Disputes
Property disputes in India can be broadly categorized into the following types:

### 1. Title Disputes
These arise when there's ambiguity about who legally owns the property. This often happens due to:
- Fraudulent sale deeds
- Forged documents
- Multiple claims on the same property
- Incomplete or irregular transfer of ownership

### 2. Boundary Disputes
Neighbors often face conflicts over property boundaries. These can escalate quickly and require proper legal resolution through surveys and documentation.

### 3. Inheritance Disputes
After the death of a property owner, disputes often arise among legal heirs regarding the distribution of assets, especially when there's no clear will.

2. **Encumbrance Certificate:** Shows if the property has any legal dues
3. **Property Tax Receipts:** Proof of tax payment
4. **Khata Certificate:** Required for property registration
5. **Building Plan Approval:** For constructed properties
