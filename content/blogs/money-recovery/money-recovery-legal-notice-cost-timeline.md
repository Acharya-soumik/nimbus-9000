# Money Recovery Legal Notice: Complete Cost & Timeline Guide (2026)

*"I want to sue him for ₹20,000."*

We hear this often. And as responsible lawyers, we sometimes have to say: *"Don't."*

Why? Because in legal battles, **ROI (Return on Investment)** matters. If you spend ₹15,000 to recover ₹20,000, you have won the battle but lost the war.

This guide provides a transparent, no-nonsense breakdown of the **Money** and **Time** involved in recovering a debt in India, so you can make a smart business decision.

## 2. The Cost of Filing a Court Case

If the notice fails and you decide to sue, the costs jump significantly.

### A. Court Fees (The Government's Cut)
To file a civil suit, you must pay "Ad Valorem" court fees—a percentage of the claim amount.
- **Example (Delhi)**: ~1% to 4% of the suit value.
- **Example (Karnataka)**: ~7% to 10% (capped at a certain limit).
- *Scenario*: To recover ₹10 Lakhs, you might have to pay **₹40,000 - ₹70,000** upfront to the court.

### B. Lawyer's Professional Fees
Litigation is not a one-time product; it's a service.
- **Filing Fee**: ₹20,000 - ₹50,000 (Initial draft and filing).
- **Per Hearing Fee**: ₹2,000 - ₹10,000 (Every time the lawyer goes to court).
- **Retainership**: Monthly charges for corporate cases.

### C. Miscellaneous Expenses
- Notary, process server fees, photocopying (thousands of pages), travel.

**Total Estimated Year 1 Cost for a ₹10 Lakh Suit**: **₹1.0 Lakh - ₹1.5 Lakhs.**

## 3. The Timeline: How Long Will I Wait?

Indian courts are famous for delays, but Money Recovery has some "Fast Lanes."

### The "Notice Phase" (Fastest)
- **Drafting**: 2 Days
- **Delivery**: 5 Days
- **Wait Period**: 15 Days
- **Total**: **20-25 Days** to know if you are getting paid or fighting.

### The "Summary Suit Phase" (Fast-Track)
If you file under **Order 37 CPC**, you skip the long trial.
- **Appearance**: Debtor must appear within 10 days.
- **Judgment**: If they have no defense, judgment can come in **6-12 Months**.

### The "Regular Suit Phase" (Slow Lane)
If you settle for a normal civil suit:
- **Timeline**: **3 to 5 Years**.
- *Avoid this unless you have no other choice.*

## 4. The Decision Matrix: Is It Worth It?

Use this table to decide your strategy based on Debt Amount.

| Debt Amount | Recommended Strategy | Why? |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **< ₹20,000** | **Informal Only** | Legal costs will eat up 50% of your recovery. Not worth the stress. |
| **₹20k - ₹1 Lakh** | **Legal Notice Only** | Send the notice (₹2,999). If they pay, great. If not, think twice before filing a suit. |
| **₹1 Lakh - ₹10 Lakh** | **Notice + Summary Suit** | The recovery amount justifies the legal investment. File under Order 37 for speed. |
| **> ₹10 Lakh** | **Full Aggression** | File Criminal Complaints (if cheque bounce) + Civil Suit + Insolvency (if company). |

## Conclusion

Don't let the fear of costs stop you from sending the initial notice. For **₹2,999**, it is the cheapest way to test the debtor's intent. If they pay, you get 100% ROI. If they don't, you can then decide whether to escalate based on the numbers above.
