With the implementation of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), 2023, the landscape of criminal laws in India has evolved. Section 356 of the BNS now governs the offense of defamation, replacing Sections 499 and 500 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).

## What is Defamation under Section 356 BNS?
Defamation is the act of communicating false statements about a person that injure their reputation. Under Section 356 BNS, whoever, by words either spoken or intended to be read, or by signs or visible representations, makes or publishes any imputation concerning any person intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm, the reputation of such person, is said to defame that person.

## Key Changes from IPC to BNS
While the core definition remains similar to the IPC, the BNS aims to streamline the legal framework. The punishment for defamation under Section 356 includes simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to two years, or with fine, or with both, or with community service.

## Types of Defamation
- **Libel:** Defamation in a permanent form, such as written words or images.
- **Slander:** Defamation in a transient form, such as spoken words or gestures.

## Exceptions to Defamation
Not everything negative said about someone is defamation. Section 356 BNS provides exceptions, including:
1. **Imputation of Truth:** It is not defamation to impute anything which is true concerning any person, if it be for the public good.
2. **Public Conduct:** Opinions expressed in good faith respecting the conduct of a public servant in the discharge of his public functions.
3. **Court Proceedings:** Faithful reports of court proceedings are protected.

## Legal Remedies: Civil vs. Criminal
Victims of defamation have two legal routes:
- **Criminal Defamation (Section 356 BNS):** The focus is on punishment (imprisonment/fine). You file a complaint before the Magistrate.
- **Civil Defamation (Tort Law):** The focus is on compensation for damages to reputation. You file a civil suit for damages.

## How to Proceed?
If your reputation has been harmed by false statements, the first step is often to send a legal notice. A **[Criminal Defamation Legal Notice](/send-legal-notice/criminal-defamation-legal-notice)** warns the offender to retract their statement and apologize, or face legal action.
