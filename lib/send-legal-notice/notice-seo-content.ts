      "It's crucial to distinguish between misconduct (willful wrongdoing) and poor performance (inability to meet standards). Misconduct involves intentional violation of rules, policies, or ethical standards and can result in immediate termination for gross misconduct. Poor performance involves inability to meet performance targets or skill deficiencies and typically requires performance improvement plans, warnings, and opportunities to improve before termination. Terminating an employee for poor performance without following progressive discipline can be challenged as wrongful termination.",

The legal notice should clearly quantify losses and demand immediate recovery to strengthen your legal position.",

      "Employee misconduct notices and disciplinary action must be meticulously documented to withstand legal scrutiny. Courts and Labor Tribunals closely examine whether natural justice was followed. Approximately 60-70% of wrongful termination cases filed by employees succeed when employers fail to follow proper procedure. A well-drafted legal notice establishing misconduct, followed by fair inquiry, significantly strengthens the employer's position. It demonstrates that termination was for valid cause and not arbitrary, protecting the employer from reinstatement orders and back wage liabilities.",
