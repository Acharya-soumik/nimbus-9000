If false and malicious statements are being spread about you—whether verbally, in print, or online—you have powerful legal remedies under the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) 2023. A Legal Notice for Criminal Defamation is the first and most effective step to stop the harassment, demand a public apology, and seek monetary compensation. Under Section 356 of BNS, defamation is a serious criminal offense punishable by up to 2 years in prison. Don't suffer in silence; take valid legal action today.",

    {
      id: "defamation-proof",
      question: "What evidence do I need to prove defamation?",
      answer:
        "To prove defamation, you need tangible evidence. For written defamation (libel), preserve original letters, emails, or publications. For online defamation, take clear screenshots showing the URL, date, and user identity immediately, as posts can be deleted. For spoken defamation (slander), you need witness statements or audio/video recordings. You must also demonstrate that the statement targets you specifically and has caused harm to your reputation.",
    },
    {
      id: "bns-vs-ipc",
      question: "Has the law changed with BNS 2023?",
      answer:
        "Structurally, the offense remains similar. Section 499 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) is now Section 356 of the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS). The definition of defamation and the exceptions (like truth, public conduct of public servants, etc.) are largely retained. The punishment also remains imprisonment of up to two years, significant fines, or both. The transition ensures all precedent judgments under IPC remain relevant.",
    },
    {
      id: "media-defamation",
      question: "Can I send a notice to a newspaper or TV channel?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Media houses do not have absolute immunity. While they have qualified privilege for 'fair reporting,' they cannot publish factually incorrect or malicious statements. If a media outlet has defamed you, you should first send a legal notice demanding a 'rejoinder' or 'clarification.' If they refuse, you can proceed with criminal and civil action.",
    },
    {
      id: "truth-defense",
      question: "Is truth a defense against defamation?",
      answer:
        "Yes, 'Truth' is an absolute defense in civil defamation. In criminal defamation, truth is a defense only if it is published for the 'public good.' Merely proving the statement is true might not be enough if the intent was solely to humiliate with no public interest involved.",
    },
    {
      id: "cyber-crime-complaint",
      question: "Should I file a Cyber Crime complaint or send a Notice?",
      answer:
        "It is recommended to do both strategically. A Legal Notice is a civil/criminal warning that often yields faster results (takedown/apology). A Cyber Crime complaint (under IT Act) is a formal police report. Using a legal notice first demonstrates your willingness to resolve the issue civilly, which strengthens your position if you later have to pursue an FIR or court complaint.",

    {
      id: "whatsapp-defamation",
      question: "Can I sue for defamation on a WhatsApp Group?",
      answer:
        "Absolutely. The administrator of a WhatsApp group and the person posting the message can be held liable. Indian courts have ruled that a WhatsApp group administrator is not liable for member content unless they approved/posted it, but the actual sender is definitely liable for criminal defamation if the message is false and harms reputation.",
    },
    {
      id: "cost-fees",
      question: "How much compensation can I ask for?",
      answer:
        "There is no upper limit. The amount depends on the extent of damage. A businessman losing a ₹1 Crore contract due to a false review can claim that amount plus damages for reputational loss. A common individual might claim damages for mental agony and social stigma. However, the claim must be realistic and justifiable in court.",
    },
    {
      id: "time-limit",
      question: "What is the time limit (Limitation Period) to file a case?",
      answer:
        "For Criminal Defamation (BNS 356), the complaint is generally expected to be filed within 3 years (as per CrPC/BNSS limitations for offenses punishable up to 3 years, though defamation is 2 years, courts act promptly). For Civil Defamation (Damages), the limitation period is 1 year from the date the libel is published or the plaintiff comes to know of it.",
    },
    {
      id: "apology-sufficiency",
      question: "If they apologize, does the case end?",
      answer:
        "Legally, the offense is committed once the statement is made. However, defamation is a 'compoundable' offense, meaning the parties can compromise. If the offender offers a satisfactory apology and you accept it, you can withdraw the legal notice or the case. Most victims prefer an apology and removal of content over a long trial.",

We offer a transparent flat fee of ₹1,499 for the notice, whereas local lawyers may charge anywhere from ₹5,000 to ₹15,000 with varying quality.

    },
    {
      id: "jurisdiction",
      question: "Where will the case be filed?",
      answer:
        "A criminal defamation complaint is typically filed in the Magistrate Court under whose jurisdiction the defamation occurred or where the victim resides and the defamation was 'published' (read/heard). Since online content is read everywhere, you often have the flexibility to file it in your city of residence.",
    },
    {
      id: "police-fir",
      question: "Can police register an FIR for defamation?",
      answer:
        "Generally, NO. Criminal Defamation is a non-cognizable offense, meaning police cannot register an FIR or arrest without a warrant. You must file a private complaint before a Judicial Magistrate. However, if the defamation includes other offenses (like stalking, criminal intimidation, or IT Act offenses), an FIR can be registered for those sections.",
