      "As a freelancer, consultant, or independent professional, unpaid invoices are a common challenge. Whether you're a graphic designer, software developer, CA, lawyer, architect, or consultant, you have the legal right to recover your professional fees. A legal notice is the first formal step to demand payment and often results in settlement without court proceedings. It establishes your seriousness and creates admissible evidence for future litigation.",

      id: "without-contract",
      question: "Can I recover fees without a written contract?",
      answer:
        "Yes. Under the principle of Quantum Meruit, you are entitled to payment for work done even without a written contract. You need to prove: (1) Work was done at client's request, (2) Client accepted/used the work, (3) Reasonable value of services. Evidence like emails, invoices, and delivered files can establish this.",
    },
    {
      id: "how-much-can-claim",
      question: "Can I claim interest on delayed payment?",
      answer:
        "Yes. You can claim interest on the unpaid amount. The standard rate is 18% per annum from the date the payment became due. This can be included in your legal notice and later claimed in court if you file a suit.",
    },
    {
      id: "client-disputes-quality",
      question: "What if the client disputes the quality of my work?",
      answer:
        "If the client accepted your deliverables (via email, payment of advance, or use of work), they cannot later dispute quality to avoid payment. Your legal notice should include proof of acceptance. If they have genuine quality concerns, they should have raised them during the project, not after completion.",
    },
    {
      id: "small-amount-worth",
      question: "Is it worth sending a notice for small amounts?",
      answer:
        "It depends on the cost-benefit. For amounts below ₹25,000, consider the cost of legal action (notice + potential court fees). However, a legal notice itself costs only ₹1,499 and often results in payment without court. For amounts above ₹50,000, it's definitely worth pursuing.",
    },
    {
      id: "limitation-period",
      question: "What is the time limit to send a legal notice?",
      answer:
        "Under the Limitation Act, you have 3 years from the date the payment became due to file a suit for recovery. However, it's best to send a legal notice as soon as the payment is significantly overdue (30-60 days) to maximize chances of recovery.",
    },
    {
      id: "client-in-different-city",
      question: "What if my client is in a different city?",
      answer:
        "Not a problem. The legal notice can be sent via registered post to the client's address anywhere in India. If you need to file a suit later, you can file it in the court where: (1) The contract was signed, (2) The work was performed, or (3) The payment was to be made (usually your city).",

    {
      id: "success-rate",
      question: "What is the success rate of legal notices for freelancers?",
      answer:
        "Approximately 70% of professional fees recovery cases settle after sending a legal notice. Clients realize that fighting a legitimate claim in court will cost them more in legal fees than simply paying the invoice. The formal legal language and threat of litigation is usually enough.",
