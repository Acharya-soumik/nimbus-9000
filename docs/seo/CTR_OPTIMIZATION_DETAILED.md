**Key metrics:**

1. Total clicks (primary metric)
2. Total impressions (should stay same or increase)
3. Average CTR (target: +1.5-2.5%)

**Keep old versions in code comments:**

```typescript
seo: {
  title: "New optimized title",

  description: "New description",
  // OLD: "Previous description"
