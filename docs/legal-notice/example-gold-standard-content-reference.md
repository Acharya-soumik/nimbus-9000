Legal Notice for Recovery of Money in India

If someone has failed to repay money owed to you—whether it is a personal loan, unpaid invoice, salary dues, or business payment—the first and most effective legal step is to send a legal notice for recovery of money.

A properly drafted legal notice puts the opposite party on formal legal notice, creates documentary evidence, and often leads to recovery without going to court.

Vakiltech helps you send a lawyer-drafted money recovery legal notice online, anywhere in India.

What Is a Legal Notice for Recovery of Money?

A legal notice for recovery of money is a formal written demand sent by an advocate to recover unpaid dues.
It informs the recipient that:

A specific amount is legally payable

The failure to pay violates legal or contractual obligations

Legal action will follow if payment is not made within a stipulated time

This notice becomes a crucial document if the dispute later goes to court.

When Can You Send a Money Recovery Legal Notice?

You can send a legal notice for recovery of money in situations such as:

Non-payment of loan amount

Unpaid business invoices or service fees

Salary or commission not paid by employer

Money lent to a friend or relative

Breach of payment terms in a contract

Advance paid but services not delivered

If your issue involves a dishonoured cheque, the matter may also require a cheque bounce legal notice under Section 138, which follows a strict legal timeline.

Common Money Recovery Scenarios We Handle

Our lawyers regularly draft recovery notices for:

Personal loan recovery

Business payment recovery

Outstanding vendor or client dues

Unpaid salary or employment dues

Advance money recovery

Freelancer and consultant payment disputes

For businesses facing repeated non-payment issues, a legal notice for outstanding payment is often the most effective first step.

What Should a Money Recovery Legal Notice Contain?

A legally valid notice must clearly include:

Details of the parties involved

Exact amount due and payment breakup

Date and reason the amount became payable

Legal grounds for recovery

Time period given for payment (usually 7–15 days)

Consequences of non-payment

Improperly drafted notices often weaken your case later. That’s why it’s important that the notice is drafted by a qualified advocate.

What Happens After Sending the Legal Notice?

After the legal notice is sent:

Payment is made – Many disputes end here

Negotiation or settlement – Lawyers may resolve the matter mutually

No response or refusal – Legal action can be initiated

Depending on the case, the next step may include:

Filing a money recovery suit

Initiating cheque bounce proceedings

Civil or criminal litigation

Your legal notice acts as proof that you attempted resolution before court action.

Is Sending a Legal Notice Mandatory?

While not mandatory in every case, sending a legal notice is strongly recommended because:

Courts view it as good-faith effort

It strengthens your legal position

It often avoids lengthy litigation

It creates written evidence

In cheque bounce matters, sending a legal notice is legally compulsory.
